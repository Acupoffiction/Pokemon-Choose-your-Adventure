        <p> ...Well at least you're not completely heartless. Still I wouldn't trust you with any pokemon of mine even if you saved a pokemon you still would use it for bad purposes, so sorry I can't give you one. Goodbye.</p>
        <p> You were kicked out of the professor's lab and began to go home with your head down. When you start to walk back you are then encountered by a suspicious trainer.</p>

        <p> Hello, I noticed you seemed fit for our oranization. After all your actions deem you fit for not a roughhouser but a worthy grunt who does not need to get down and dirty. Welcome to team Crimson...</p>
